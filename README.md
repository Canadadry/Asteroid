Asteroid
========

This is a simple AsteroidGame build with SFML 2.0
The architecture and feature are inspired by http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/avoiding-the-blob-antipattern-a-pragmatic-approach-to-entity-composition--gamedev-1113

I've tried to make my code as cleaner and simpla as possible.
I hope this will help you. :)
